Minesweeper Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

How to Play
Objective: The objective of the game is to clear the minefield without detonating any mines. The player wins by revealing all cells that do not contain mines.

Game Interface:

Upon launching the game, you'll see a grid of cells. Each cell represents a square on the game board.
Clicking on a cell reveals its content.
Right-clicking on a cell marks it as a potential mine location.
The number displayed on a cell represents the number of mines adjacent to that cell.
Rules:

If you click on a cell containing a mine, you lose the game.
If you reveal all cells that do not contain mines, you win the game.
Customization:

The game grid is set to a default size of 6x6, with 9 randomly placed mines. You can adjust the grid size and number of mines by modifying the GRID_SIZE constant in the code.
Running the Game
To run the game, execute the Python script (minesweeper.py). Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary dependencies (tkinter).

python minesweeper.py
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
Known Issues
Currently, this implementation works on Windows systems due to the usage of ctypes.windll.user32.MessageBoxW for displaying message boxes. For other platforms, adjustments may be needed.
